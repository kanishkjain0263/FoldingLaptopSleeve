# Folding Laptop Sleeve

The most common problem among working professionals and students, studying or
working in an IT field is back pain or neck pain. Along with this, working with a
mouse everywhere is not practical as it does not function properly on all surfaces
and carrying a mouse pad is not practical. So, to solve this problem I propose a
design of a laptop sleeve which will not only function as a simple laptop
case/cover, but also as a folding stand. Along with this, it will also feature a
detachable mouse pad to make it possible to use a mouse whenever and wherever
required. Separate compartments will be provided for storage of devices such as
cables, mouse, keyboard, and so on. Identical to the mouse pad, a solution for the
heating problem will be provided.
